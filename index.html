        <h3>Landing at Fiumicino Airport</h3>
        <h4>Day 1 - 11:46am </h4>
        <p>After landing, we had to search for our driver at the crowded pickup area. After waiting about 20 minutes, he showed up, a short Italian man that spoke pretty decent English. He would be our driver for a few other days as well. He felt like a tour guide himself with all the information he was giving on our descent to Rome. History was flowing through the area way before we even got to the city borders with aqueducts and other strucutres.</p>

        <h3>Arriving in Roma</h3>
        <h4>Day 1 - 1:02pm</h4>
        <p>Once we finally got all of our stuff in and settled, we decided to explore the surrounding streets for restaurants and entertainment. Basically outside of our door were Chinese and Italian restaurants with street performers and artist everywhere. There were also a multitude of stores, between tourist grabs and genuinely priced Italian goods.</p>

        <h3>La Capricciosa</h3>
        <h4>Day 1 - 5:45pm</h4>
        <p>At La Capricciosa I had my first legal drink! My mom, sister, and I all got the house white wine, while my dad got a glass of house red. While debating whether to stay there for food, my sister was approached by a man with a rose that spoke no English. He gave her the rose, she said thank you and wouldn't turn away, expecting money in return. Now learning that that is a normal thing to happen in Italy.</p>

        <h3>Antica Osteria Croce</h3>
        <h4>Day 1 - 9:15pm</h4>
        <p>After lounging about and looking up a ton of reviews, we decided to find a new restaurant to dine at. Antica Osteria Croce was one that we stumbled upon on our way back, and it sounded great! I started off with a Pi√±a Colada, practicing the little bit of Italian I knew along the way. We all shared Pizza Formaggio and Pizza Carbonara. The pizza was phenomenal, and was a great way to introduce our tastebuds to Italy.</p>

        <h3>Walking Through History</h3>
        <h4>Day 2 - 9:30am</h4>
        <p>We started our day off early with a walking tour. Our guide came to the entrance to our apartment and that is when the tour began. Our apartment was walking distance to the Spanish Steps, on a street called Via de Grecci, so it only made sense to start here. The area around the Spanish Steps were astounding, there were hundreds of tourist flooding in on the foot traffic only area. As our guide gave a history lesson through the chatter of surrounding people, I captured some pictures of people getting water from the fountains.</p>

        <h3>A Story in Every Detail</h3>
        <h4>Day 2 - 10:07am</h4>
        <p>Every single building and structure found in Rome has some sort of tale behind it. The column for Saint Mary gets draped in flowers certain times in the year, while the only Spanish Embassy in Italy stands across from it. A lot of things seen had been touched or crafted by Bernini which I had been learning all about in my online Art History course I'd been taking. There is a church/ basilica on every corner and our guide took us into a beautiful one called Basilica Di Sant'Andrea Delle Fratte that he knew looked like many others. So he suggested not stopping at every single one you see!</p>

        <h3>Fontana di Trevi</h3>
        <h4>Day 2 - 10:20am</h4>
        <p>Here was another busy stop on our tour, the Trevi Fountain. The guide gave us a lesson about how the building once was free standing, and normal, but later was carved into to make a masterpiece. The water here is drinkable, but I wouldn't suggest trying it straight from the pool unless you want to get yelled and whistled at by the guards. There is a small section where fresh water flows on the right that you may drink from though! After pushing our way through the flock of people to get to the water, my mom and sister threw in their coins, the correct way of course. And for some reason, I just took pictures and didn't partake.</p>

        <h3>Pantheon</h3>
        <h4>Day 2 - 11:10am</h4>
        <p>After a short walk from the Trevi, we arrived at the Pantheon. It was commisioned by Marcus Agrippa during Augustus reign as you can see inscribed at the entrance. It was formerly a temple, now church, and is home to the grave of Raphael. When we were visiting, they actually were in prayer, while the tourist flooded in around them. Our guide was very insightful and taught us about a lot of different contributors, and how Raphael just simply asked to be buried there, and he was the first artist to gain that honor.</p>

        <h3>Piazza Navona</h3>
        <h4>Day 2 - 11:40am</h4>
        <p>We ended our tour at Piazza Navona, where our guide told us about the Stadium of Domitian that this was built upon. In the center of the plazza was the Fountain of the Four Rivers representing the Nile in Africa, Danube in Europe, Ganges in Asia, and the Rio de la Plata for the Americas. They are represented by showing characteristics such as animals and plants that are native to the area. We were pointed in the direction of the Market at Campo Dei Fiori and found a restaurant next door called La Carbonara.</p>

        <h3>La Carbonara</h3>
        <h4>Day 2 - 12:57pm</h4>
        <p>This place looked very fancy and elegant but finding the entrance was confusing. We entered through what seemed to be the dining area and were seated there as the man also did not speak great English. We were served little tomato filled pastries as a starter along with little breadsticks. I decided since it was only around 1pm I would stick to water, none of my family followed suit. I ordered the Bucatini all' Amatriciana which was the sister dish to the Carbonara. My dad ordered the Carbonara, one of many times, and I compared them and it seemed as if I made the right choice. Mine was a tomato sauce based dish with onions, bacon bits, and pecorino cheese.</p>

        <h3>Venchi</h3>
        <h4>Day 2 - 2:46pm</h4>
        <p>The guide suggested we made a stop for Venchi on our way back, which is an amazing gelato shop. We did pass quite a few on our strolls, so it seems to be a chain, but it was delicious nonetheless. I ordered the Gelato Tiramisu y Cremino which ended up being a great combination of coffee and creamy flavors.</p>

        <h3>La Buvette</h3>
        <h4>Day 2 - 9:38pm</h4>
        <p>After a long day of walking, finished up with relaxing and discussing where to get dinner, we ended up at La Buvette. My drink was La Vie en Rose, which was a lot more dry than I had wished for it to be. A Paris sparkling wine with rose and gin sounded pretty sweet, but it sadly was not. My meal was the Fettuccelle with Black Truffle Cream, which for some reason I was also kind of dissapointed with. It was good the sauce just didn't scream truffle, and it was dulled down by the black pepper. I did try my moms Eggplant Lasagna and that was actually fantastic.</p>
